# Particle Simulation with QuadTree

This is a JavaScript-based interactive simulation that models the gravitational interaction of particles in a 2D space. The simulation takes place on an HTML5 Canvas, allowing you to visualize the motion and interactions of particles.

## Features

- Particle Motion: Particles move in response to gravitational forces between each other.
- Panning and Zooming: You can pan around the simulation area and zoom in/out to explore different parts of the canvas.
- Particle Spawning: You can spawn individual particles by clicking on the canvas or spawn disks of particles in circular formations.
- User Interface: The simulation includes buttons to toggle particle orbit display, reset the simulation, remove particles, toggle particle spawning modes, and control simulation speed.

## Getting Started

1. Visit https://sagresnaw.github.io/2dgravity-space/

## Usage

- **Mouse Controls:** 
  - Right-click and drag to pan around the canvas.
  - Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.

- **Buttons:**
  - "Guide" button toggles the display of particle orbits.
  - "Reset" button resets the simulation by clearing and spawning new particles.
  - "Remove" button removes all particles from the simulation.
  - "‚≠êÔ∏è" button toggles particle spawning mode.
  - "üí´" button toggles disk spawning mode.
  - "off" button turns off both particle and disk spawning modes.
  - "||" button pauses or resumes the simulation.
  - "-" and "+" buttons adjust the simulation speed.

- **Clicking on Canvas:**
  - Clicking on the canvas with the "‚≠êÔ∏è" mode active spawns individual particles.
  - Clicking on the canvas with the "üí´" mode active spawns disks of particles.

- **Known Bugs:**
  - Camera and Mouse pointer become decoupled causing placement of particle/disks of particles to be offset from mouse.



The idea comes from an old flash game that has been lost to time.
